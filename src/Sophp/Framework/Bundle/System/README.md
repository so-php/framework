# SystemBundle
The system bundle is a special bundle that represents the SOPHP framework.

  * Stopping the bundle has the effect of shutting down the OSGi framework for the current runtime (it can be restarted)
  * The symbolic name of a system bundle varies depending on the implementation, but it will always be aliased as `system.bundle` so that other bundles can refer to it.
